As urbanization continues to thrive, indoor noise pollution has emerged as a growing and
often overlooked problem. From loud neighbors and street traffic to sounds from household
appliances, noise pollution negatively affects mental health, concentration, and sleep quality.
Despite advancements in building materials and acoustic technology, a practical and
affordable solution that fully eliminates indoor noise disturbances remains elusive.
One promising but underutilized technology is acoustic metamaterials â€” artificially
engineered materials that manipulate sound waves in unprecedented ways. These materials
can block, absorb, and redirect sound across a wide frequency spectrum, including lowfrequency noise that traditional methods struggle to handle.
